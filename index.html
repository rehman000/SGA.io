					<h5>1.	Change your nickname to a reasonable name that other people [specifically I] can easily identify you with. (Or else I will do it for you.)</h5>
					<h5>2.	Be nice to your fellow club members and to yourself. (C'mon now, play nice, please?)</h5>
					<h4>3.	Maintain a safe environment for everyone. (No toxicity is needed here. It spikes my anxiety levels...)</h5>
					<h5>4.	No throwing anyone under the bus unless they truly deserve it. (Judgement will be made by the E-board.)</h5>
					<h5>5.	Keep lewd stuff to a near minimum. (This is a server to bring people together. Not an excuse to unload your spank bank from your hard drive.)</h5>
					<h5>6.	Any lost items found in any of our events must be reported to #lost-and-found so they can safely return to their owner. (Finders keepers don't apply here.)</h5>
					<h5>7.	If you want to address a single individual in chat, you can ping them with "@[insert name here]". (Don't be surprised if they react with anger emotes.)</h5>
					<h5>8.	If you have a problem with someone in the Discord, DO NOT bring others involved in your conflicts. Resolve that stuff in private where other people don't have to see you act like clowns. (Settle it in Smash like civilized folk.)</h5>
					<h5>9.	All bot interaction shall be done only in #bot-stuff. (Beep boop.)</h5>
					<h5>10.	If you are getting tired of all the notifications coming in your feed, feel free to mute certain channels so your phone can stop "blowing up". (If I'm annoyed by notifications, then so will anyone else.)</h5>
					<h5>11.	Make friends, have fun! (most important one of all!)</h5>
